conley-morse-database -- computational dynamics software

See "INSTALL" for installation notes.

DATABASE SOFTWARE:
Brief instructions on using the database software:
  A) Change directory to conley-morse-database
  B) TYPE: make clean
  C) TYPE: make SingleCMG
  D) TYPE: ./SingleCMG 20 20
     Output should start streaming down the screen
     Pretty quickly the program should terminate
     and some output files ought to be produced.
     You can tinker with this example by editing
     ./source/test/SingleCMG.cpp
  E) TYPE: ./CMDB ./data/leslie12/
     It should compile "Conley_Morse_Database"
     If you are on a cluster with PBS, it will attempt
      to submit a job with qsub.
     Otherwise, it will complain that it doesn't know the
      command qsub. Proceed to:
  F) TYPE: mpiexec -np 5 ./Conley_Morse_Database ./data/leslie12/
     It should start computing. The file "progress.txt" should be
     periodically refreshed to indicate progress.
     Likely you'll want to do this on a cluster, however.

To compute on different models, produce a different data directory, with
config.xml and ModelMap.h files following the example of the "leslie12"
example. Beware of errors in these files, however!
