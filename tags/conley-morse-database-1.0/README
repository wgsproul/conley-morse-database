DATABASE SOFTWARE:
Brief instructions on using the database software:

To run the "SingleCMG" software:
  A) Change directory to conley-morse-database
  B) TYPE: make clean
  C) TYPE: make SingleCMG MODELDIR=./data/Leslie
  D) TYPE: cd ./data/Leslie
           ./SingleCMG 20 20
     Output should start streaming down the screen
     Pretty quickly the program should terminate
     and some output files ought to be produced.
     You can also try out using the other model directories.
     See the batch script "TESTS".

To run the full database "Conley_Morse_Database" software:
  E) TYPE: ./CMDB ./data/Leslie/
     It should compile "Conley_Morse_Database"
     If you are on a cluster with PBS, it will attempt
      to submit a job with qsub.
     Otherwise, it will complain that it doesn't know the
      command qsub. Proceed to:
  F) TYPE: mpiexec -np 5 ./Conley_Morse_Database ./data/Leslie/
     It should start computing. The file "progress.txt" should be
     periodically refreshed to indicate progress.
     Likely you'll want to do this on a cluster, however.

To compute on different models, produce a different data directory, with
config.xml and ModelMap.h files following the example of the "Leslie"
example.
