Unit tests are written using cutter testing framework 
  http://cutter.sourceforge.net/
If you want to run unit tests, you need to
  (1) Install cutter (please see the installation manual of cutter)
  (2) Modify makefile.config for your environment
  (3) Type "make -f makefile.unittest run-unittests" on your terminal
      to build tests and to run those tests
You will get the message of "100% passed" after some log messages.
