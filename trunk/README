conley-morse-database -- computational dynamics software

See "INSTALL" for installation notes.

DATABASE SOFTWARE:
Brief instructions on using the database software:
  A) Change directory to conley-morse-database
  B) TYPE: make clean
  C) TYPE: make SingleCMG MODELDIR=./examples/Leslie2D
  D) TYPE: cd ./examples/Leslie2D
           ./SingleCMG ./ 20 20
     Output should start streaming down the screen
     Pretty quickly the program should terminate
     and some output files ought to be produced.
  E) TYPE: ./CMDB ./examples/Leslie2D/
     It should compile "Conley_Morse_Database"
     If you are on a cluster with PBS, it may attempt
      to submit a job with qsub.
     Otherwise, it may complain that it doesn't know the
      command qsub. Proceed to:
  F) TYPE: cd ./examples/Leslie2D
     TYPE: mpiexec -np 5 ./Conley_Morse_Database ./
     It should start computing. The file "progress.txt" should be
     periodically refreshed to indicate progress.
     Likely you'll want to do this on a cluster, however.

To compute on different models, produce a different data directory, with
config.xml and ModelMap.h files following the example of the "Leslie2D"
example. Beware of errors in these files, however!
