INSTALLATION DIRECTIONS (and some brief instructions)
-----------------------------------------------------
(0) Install "conley-morse-database"
Note: If you are reading this, you likely 
      have already done this, unless you are 
      browsing the source on the web.
Details:
  A) TYPE: svn checkout http://conley-morse-database.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ conley-morse-database

(1) Install "cluster-delegator"
Details:
  A) Change directory to parent directory of conley-morse-databse
  B) TYPE: svn checkout http://cluster-delegator.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ cluster-delegator
  

(2) Install Boost. 
 (Note. V1.48.0 has a problem with
  assignment of temporaries with boost::unordered_map, 
  use V1.47.0 until this is resolved)
Details:
 A) Download the boost tarball,
    decompress it, 
    and cd to the boost dir (It doesn't matter where you put this --
    you can even delete it when you are done.)
 B) TYPE sudo ./bootstrap.sh
 C) TYPE sudo ./b2 install
  Note: I've noticed (C) doesn't work for some older macs.
        Try installing instead with 
         sudo ./bjam install     
        if you are having problems.
 D) Check the boost installation was successful by seeing that
    /usr/local/include/boost/ exists and has lots of header files.
  and /usr/local/lib/ contains boost libraries (.a, .so, and/or .dylib files)

(3) Install MPI if it is not installed already. 
Notes: Mac Users: For Mac OS X 10.4 - 10.6, this comes standard.
                  For Mac OS X 10.7, it does not.  
    You can check if it is installed by seeing if the command
    "mpicxx" is recognized.
Details:
 A) Download open-mpi from the internet.
 B) cd openmpi-1.4.4
 C) sudo ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
 D) sudo make all install

(4) Install CImg
I recommend placing CImg.h in /usr/local/include
(You can put it anywhere and edit the makefile)


CHOMP SOFTWARE:
The chomp software is header-only and can be used by
including files in ./conley-morse-database/include/chomp/
You don't need to build anything except your own program!

DATABASE SOFTWARE:
Brief instructions on using the database software:
  A) Change directory to conley-morse-database
  B) TYPE: make clean
  C) TYPE: make SingleCMG
  D) TYPE: ./SingleCMG 20 20
     Output should start streaming down the screen
     Pretty quickly the program should terminate 
     and some output files ought to be produced.
     You can tinker with this example by editing
     ./source/test/SingleCMG.cpp 
  E) TYPE: ./CMDB ./data/leslie12/
     It should compile "Conley_Morse_Database"
     If you are on a cluster with PBS, it will attempt
      to submit a job with qsub.
     Otherwise, it will complain that it doesn't know the
      command qsub. Proceed to:
  F) TYPE: mpiexec -np 5 ./Conley_Morse_Database ./data/leslie12/
     It should start computing. The file "progress.txt" should be
     periodically refreshed to indicate progress. 
     Likely you'll want to do this on a cluster, however.

To compute on different models, produce a different data directory, with
config.xml and ModelMap.h files following the example of the "leslie12"
example. Beware of errors in these files, however!
