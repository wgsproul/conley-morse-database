INSTALLATION DIRECTIONS (and some brief instructions)
-----------------------------------------------------

Mac Users: Try typing ./MACINSTALL
Read through this file if you have problems.
Contact me at sharker@math.rutgers.edu if they persist.

The installation requires the following prerequisite packages:

boost
open-mpi 
cmake
sdsl-lite  
X11
CImg
cluster-delegator
conley-morse-database
GraphViz
capd <optional>


INSTALLATION DIRECTORIES

Packages install themselves into some directory which we
will call <install-directory>.

There are two basic choices for an install directory. One
is to use a system directory like /usr/local or /opt, which
exist for this purpose. However these require a password
to install into. The other choice is to perform installs into
a home directory, like ~.

The <install-directory> is chosen by the user for each
package. It can always be chosen to be a folder in the
user's home directory. However some packages might already
be installed, usually in /usr/local. Also, the useful "brew" 
installer on Mac OS X installs software into /usr/local.

It is recommended to use a system installation directory 
(e.g. /usr/local) for
cmake, open-mpi, boost, and sdsl-lite

and a home installation directory (e.g. ~) for
cluster-delegator and conley-morse-database

In what follows, we will refer to the <install-directory>
of cluster-delegator and conley-morse-database
as <home-install-dir> and the others as <system-install-dir>

HEADERS, LIBRARIES, AND BINARIES

The effect of installing boost, cmake, open-mpi, and sdsl-lite
is to produce:
* header files, which are placed in 
  <system-install-dir>/include
* libraries, which are placed in
  <system-install-dir>/lib
* binaries, which are placed in
  <system-install-dir>/bin

The effect of installing cluster-delegator and conley-morse-database
is just to produce their folders. Inside of these folders there
are include folders, but they do not attempt to install these header
files into the system.

MODIFYING THE PATH

Both cmake and open-mpi create binaries, so for these programs
to function you need to have <system-install-dir>/bin on your
UNIX path. If <system-install-dir> is /usr/local for these installs
(recommended) then most likely nothing needs to be done. Otherwise,
Edit the ~/.bash_profile file to contain the line
 PATH="<system-install-dir>/bin:${PATH}"
You may need to restart your terminal program for the changes to
take effect.

GENERIC INSTRUCTIONS

The generic instructions for open-mpi, boost, cmake, and sdsl-lite are
* Download the package to some folder
* Run its installer, telling it what <system-install-dir> you want

For cluster-delegator and conley-morse-database, the instructions are
* Download the package directly to <home-install-dir> from the repository.

MAC USERS AND BREW
Mac Users:
Some of these installs can be accomplished with "brew". This will 
choose <system-install-dir>= /usr/local 
Obtain brew by typing:

ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/go)"

LIST OF SPECIFIC INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS

(1) Install Boost. (see their website)
Mac OS X::
brew install boost

Linux:
./bootstrap.sh --prefix=<system-install-dir>
./b2 install

(2) Install MPI if it is not installed already. 
Mac OS X:
brew install open-mpi

Linux:
Download open-mpi from the internet and cd to its folder
./configure --prefix=<system-install-dir>
make all install

(3) Install "cmake"
Note: We require "cmake" to build "sdsl-lite"
On Mac OS X:
brew install cmake

On Linux:
  Download and decompress the tarball from 
  http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html  
  This might be done from the command line with:

curl http://www.cmake.org/files/v2.8/cmake-2.8.10.2.tar.gz \
      -o cmake-2.8.10.2.tar.gz
tar xvfz cmake-2.8.10.2.tar.gz
./bootstrap --prefix=<system-install-dir>
make
make install

(4) Install "sdsl"
  SDSL is maintained as a git repository. 
  https://github.com/simongog/sdsl-lite

  To install it:

  git clone https://github.com/simongog/sdsl-lite.git
  cd sdsl-lite
  ./install.sh <system-install-dir>

(5) Install "conley-morse-database"

svn checkout http://conley-morse-database.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ \ 
             <home-install-dir>/conley-morse-database

(6) Install "cluster-delegator"

svn checkout http://cluster-delegator.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ \ 
             <home-install-dir>/cluster-delegator

(7) Install CAPD (optional)
  CAPD provides an integrator which can be used to create time-t
  maps arising from ordinary differential equations (ODEs).

  If one does not want to build time-t maps using CAPD, this
  step is not necessary.

  See the CAPD documentation for up to date details on installation.

  As of this writing, the following seems to work:
    A package called "pkg-config" is required.
    This is often pre-installed.
    On Mac OS X, it can be obtained with the brew installer with
      brew install pkg-config
  
  Now from the CAPD folder:
    ./configure
    make
    make install

Final steps.
The conley-morse-database/makefile.config
file may need to be edited if the recommendations were not
taken. By default it assumes
 <system-install-dir>=/usr/local
 and <home-install-dir> is the parent folder
 of conley-morse-database. 

The folders where boost and sdsl can be found can be changed
from these default locations.

In the future a better system will be deployed so
the user does not have to directly edit a makefile.

See README file for further instructions.
