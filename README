DATABASE SOFTWARE:
Brief instructions on using the database software:

To run the "SingleCMG" software:
  A) Change directory to conley-morse-database
  B) TYPE: make clean
  C) TYPE: make SingleCMG MODELDIR=./examples/Leslie
  D) TYPE: cd ./examples/Leslie
           ./SingleCMG 20 20
     Output should start streaming down the screen
     Pretty quickly the program should terminate
     and some output files ought to be produced.
     You can also try out using the other model directories.
     See the batch script "TESTS".

To run the full database "Conley_Morse_Database" software:
  E) TYPE: ./CMDB ./examples/Leslie/
     It should compile "Conley_Morse_Database"
     It will place the executable in ./examples/Leslie
     Then it will call the script "SUBMIT" which executes the command
     mpiexec -np 5 ./examples/Leslie/Conley_Morse_Database ./examples/Leslie/
     
     It should start computing. The file "progress.txt" should be
     periodically refreshed to indicate progress.
     Likely you'll want to do this on a cluster, however, in which case
     you should modify the SUBMIT script to use "qsub" or whatever is 
     appropriate on your cluster.

To compute on different models, produce a different data directory, with
config.xml and ModelMap.h files following the example of the "Leslie"
example.
