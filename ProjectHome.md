This software provides a mathematical tool using Conley Index theory and Morse decompositions to describe dynamical systems. The main principle is described in

More recently it has been described in

The software is written in C++ and uses the Boost libraries. Additionally, it uses the SDSL (Succinct Data Structure Library), see

For homology computations, we make use of CHomP, which is included. These homology algorithms rely on discrete Morse theory algorithms. See

To characterize Conley Index, we use field coefficients and must find the Frobenius Normal form of an induced map on homology. CHomP provides the induced map on homology. To find the Frobenius Normal form we use the algorithm of Storjohann:
